# Kaptioner ML
This Repostitory contains the files that form the Machine Learning Model for the Kaptioner Web App https://github.com/PrinceGupta1999/Kaptioner .
We have built a Image to Sequence Model consisting of an Encoder which makes use of Convolutional Nueral Networks and processes all the images and generates a corresponding feature vector, A Decoder which processes the feature vector using Recurrent Nueral Network consisting of LSTM layers and gives the desired output Information Labels.
